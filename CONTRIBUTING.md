# Contributing

You can contribute in 3 ways: creating issues, opening pull requests, and reviewing pull requests.
## Creating Issues

Feel free to create an issue if you encounter any problems, have any suggestions, or would like a specific new algorithm or language to be included. Open a new PR directly in cases of minor corrections or inclusion of algorithms already listed in a language not yet implemented.

Before creating the issue, check for similar issues and remember to detail the problem encountered or proposed suggestion.

## Opening Pull Requests

It is also possible to contribute by opening a Pull Request (PR) with a solution to a problem or including a new algorithm.

When opening a PR, remember to include a relevant description of the changes made and add a link in the project's README if new algorithms are incorporated.

## Reviewing Pull Requests

Another way to contribute to the project is by reviewing open PRs. If you have mastery of an algorithm, data structure, or even a specific programming language, feel free to help review the open PRs.

When reviewing, remember to be cordial/polite and, if possible, manually test the change or correction before approving the PR.
